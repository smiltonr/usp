* Exercise 1
1. Launch a terminal.
2. Check which group or groups you belong to.
3. Use the =umask= command to set the default permission to
   =700=. What is the default permission for files after this command?
4. Create a directory named =chapter4= under your home directory.
5. Check the default permission of this directory. Is it =700=?
6. Create a directory under the =chapter4= directory (without moving
   from your home directory) and name it =session1=.
7. Check the permission of this directory. Is it =700=?
8. Move to the =session1= directory.
9. Create a file named =hw41= under this directory. Save this file.
10. Check the permission of this file. Is it =700= or =600=? Why?
    Explain the difference between the permissions for files and
    directories.
11. Do users in your group have any access to this file? Do other
    users (outside of your group) have any access to this file? 
12. Change the permissions to allow users in your group only to copy
    this file to their own directories. Is there a need to change
    the permission of any directories? If yes, make  necessary changes.
13. Let a user in your group copy this file into her home
    directory. Was the copy successful? If not, find the reason and
    take the appropriate action(s) to correct it. Then try again with
    the other user in your group.
14. Quit the terminal. 

* Exercise 2
1. Launch a terminal.
2. Check which group or groups you belong to.
3. Check your default mask.
4. Create a d1rectory called =garbage= under your home directory.
5. Check the permission of this directory. Make a note of it.
6. Change your default mask so that the default permission is
   =664=. What is the default permission for directories after you
   make this change?
7. Check the permission for the =garbage= directory. Has it been
   changed after setting the default mask? Why or why not?
8. Delete this directory.
9. Create a directory called =session2= under the =chapter4=
   directory.
10. Check the permission of this directory and make a note of it.
11. Remove the =x= permission for the user from this directory.
12. Move to the =session2= directory. You should have a problem. Do
    you know what the problem is? Fix the problem.
13. Create a file named =hw42= under this directory. Save this file.
14. Check the permissions of this file. Can users in your group copy
    this file? Can they change this file? Can users outside your group
    copy this file? Can they change this file? Is this file
    executable?
15. Change the permissions of this file so that every user can read,
    modify, but not execute this file.
17. Quit the terminal.
